# Demo Fastify App

This project is a demo Fastify web API for managing ice creams, implemented with TypeScript, SQLite, and using `pnpm` as the package manager. The project includes CRUD endpoints for managing ice creams and comes with a CI pipeline that runs automated tests, linting, and formatting checks using GitHub Actions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ (v18 recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (if not installed globally, install using `corepack enable pnpm`)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the Fastify server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The app exposes the following CRUD endpoints to manage ice creams:

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                | Description              |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| `POST`      | `/icecreams`             | Create a new ice cream    |
| `GET`       | `/icecreams`             | Get all ice creams        |
| `PUT`       | `/icecreams/:id`         | Update an ice cream       |
| `DELETE`    | `/icecreams/:id`         | Delete an ice cream       |

### Example Request (Create Ice Cream)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/icecreams \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Chocolate Darko", "flavor": "Chocolate", "price": 200}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Chocolate Darko",
  "flavor": "Chocolate",
  "price": 200
}
```

## Testing

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. You can run the test suite with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will run all the unit tests defined for the CRUD operations.

## Linting and Formatting

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.

### To check for linting errors:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### To check for formatting issues:

```bash
pnpm format --check
```

### To automatically fix linting and formatting issues:

```bash
pnpm lint --fix
pnpm format
```
